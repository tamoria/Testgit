# Start by creating a module -a file ending in .py
# Write your function
# open another file and add "import" followed by the name of the module
# see pizza.py and make_pizza.py for example

'''Importing Specific Functions

general syntax: 

from module_name import function_name

You can import as many functions as you want:

from module_name import function_0, function_1, ...

Example:

from pizza import make_pizza'''

# Using as to Give a Function an Alias - in the case the name might conflict with other names in your program:

'''from pizza import make_pizza as mp      # make_pizza is now called mp

mp(16, 'tomato')'''

# Using as to Give a Module an Alias

'''import pizza as p

p.make_pizza(12, 'cheese')'''

# Importing All Functions in a Module

'''from pizza import *'''

from function_and_returning import greet_user

greet_user('sam')
